# Digital-Scarecrow-IoT-ML
Developed an AI-powered agricultural surveillance system using Raspberry Pi 5 and YOLOv8 to detect crop-destroying animals in real-time. The system uses deterrent sounds, monitors environmental conditions, and sends alerts via the Blynk IoT app. It enables remote farm management and supports precision agriculture with scalable, low-cost solutions.
